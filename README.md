| [VS: How CNN Works EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulbasitniazi/vs-how-cnn-works-eda)                              | In this project, I explore the visual similarities between different CNN architectures using dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques.                                                                                |
| [ResNet50 EDA: Transfer Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulbasitniazi/resnet50-eda-transfer-learning)           | In this project, I use the pre-trained ResNet50 model to perform transfer learning on the  brain tumor dataset                                                           |
| [EfficientNetB7 Explained + 98% Fine-tuning EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulbasitniazi/enetb7-explained-98-fine-tuning-eda) | In this project, I explain the architecture of EfficientNetB7 and use it to perform transfer learning on the pistachio image dataset, achieving a test accuracy of 98%.                                                                 |
| [ResNet50 from Scratch EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulbasitniazi/resnet50fromscratch-eda)                      | In this project, I implement the ResNet50 architecture from scratch and train it on the animal dataset and perform multi image classification.                                                                      |
